This repo contains code that calls a [Twilio Function](https://www.twilio.com/console/runtime/functions/manage) which returns a Pokemon joke or two in Plain Text as well as JSON.

To run the app, you will need a [Twilio account](https://twilio.com/try-twilio) to make a [Twilio Function](https://www.twilio.com/console/runtime/functions/manage) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

## Make a Twilio Function
This Twilio Function for our purposes will return a simple hard-coded Pikachu joke. To make that, [on your Functions](https://www.twilio.com/console/runtime/functions), click the red "+" button to make a new Function.

If this is your first Function, you'll instead click "Create a Function".

Then select "Blank" to create a Blank Functions Template, and click "Create". You will be redirected directly into your new Function. There on the next page give your Function a name like "Pokemon-Swift-Function" and add on to the path (which is unique to you) something like "/swift".

Since we will be calling this Twilio Function directly from a mobile app, the inbound HTTP request will not be signed by Twilio. Make sure to leave this Access Control checkbox unchecked, as shown below.

You can also leave "Event" untouched. In the code section add the following JavaScript, which is used in Twilio Functions, to return our basic Pokemon joke:
```
exports.handler = function(context, event, callback) {
    const joke = 'Why canâ€™t Pokemon play hide-and-seek? Because they\'ll Pikachu!';
    callback(null, joke);
}
```
Click the red "Save" button at the bottom and your Twilio Function should be deploying and should return a single Pokemon joke. You can test that your Function is running by visiting the Function URL path (which you can copy from under `Properties` above) in a web browser, like below.

Then in the iOS code, open up your `ViewController` and replace "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-TWILIO-FUNCTION" with that Twilio Function URL.
